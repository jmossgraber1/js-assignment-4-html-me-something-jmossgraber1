      THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW MUCH I LOVE PIZZA
   </head>
   <body>
     I've eaten a lot of pizza. I have strong feelings about pizza. Here is a list:
      1. NY style is superior to all others
      2. Bad pizza is usually better than no pizza
      3. Provel is trash and a big reason why the word "usually" is included in the rule above
      4. Using a fork and knife is weird but I guess what folks in Naples do so what do I know
      5. Driving in Naples was one of the most exciting things I've ever done. We ate pizza rossa there
      6. Pizza doesn't need cheese to be great
